# Cloudinit

`Cloudinit` is an utility provided by some VM base images (so called `cloudimages`) provided by some linux distribution. It allows for defining certain further setup steps for a newly created VM, like which packages should get installed after initial setup, which SSH keys and users should be setup on the system and many more.
